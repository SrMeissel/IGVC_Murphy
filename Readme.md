Introduction:
  This is the software for MURPHY, Embry-riddle's entry for the 2023 IGVC competition. MURPHY Exists because the original vehicle GAVIN got stuck in shipping and would not arrive until the compeition finished. Since the team was already in michigan, we decided not to sit around and wait to go home, instead we decided to create MURPHY. 
  MURPHY is built according the the requirements of the AVOUSI IGVC 2023 competition. In summary, its goal is to autonomously navigate a course by passing predetermined GPS waypoints without colliding with obstcles and adhering to a lane.
